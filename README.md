# Effective Pandas 2
This repo contains exercises, experiments, etc. related to the book [Effective Pandas 2](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book), by Matt Harrison. Though I have already been using Pandas for several years, this book has a stellar reputation for providing effective coding patterns.

My setup uses `pyenv` (hence the `.python-version` file) and more recent versions of libraries than the book, but otherwise follows the setup found in Section 2.2. `pandas-env`, the virtual environment directory, gets quite large, so I don't include it in this Git repo (see `.gitignore`); it needs to be recreated and reactivated for each machine this repo is cloned to.

If you're here, you may also be interested in the [author's official repo](https://github.com/mattharrison/effective_pandas_book) for the book.
